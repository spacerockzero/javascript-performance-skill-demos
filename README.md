# Demos for JavaScript Performance Micro-Badge
https://github.com/fs-webdev/skill-building-program/blob/master/badges-active/javascript/_micro_javascript-performance.md

- [x] When it's an appropriate time to micro-optimize: `when-to-micro-optimize.md`
- [ ] Perform a JavaScript profile, and determine where in a script the most time and memory is used
- [ ] Fix some known expensive JavaScript operations
- [ ] Use JavaScript micro-timing to accurately record how long a function takes
- [ ] Show the "Big-O" complexity of at least two different operations in JavaScript
- [ ] Show how one of the previous two operations might be optimized to achieve a lower algorithmic complexity
- [ ] Show the effect of inner loops on JavaScript performance, and how to optimize them
